# Native & RxJS Observables: A Direct Comparison

This is the accompanying code for the video "Native & RxJS Observables: A Direct Comparison". The videos discusses the differences and similarities between native JavaScript observables and RxJS observables.

This repo also contains the type declarations for the native observables, which are not included in the TypeScript standard library. The type declarations are located in the `src/observable.d.ts` file.
